#Women Empowerment

Trying to make a women safety application that will fetch the user's location(in terms of latitude and longitude) and then send the location to nearby locals who are willing to help. These locals also would have registered into the application. 

Currently working on the database part of this application. Fetching local's location from the app and storing it to the database.Building a function that will be called to check the distance of the local from the woman's location for ease of approach. Classifying locals on the basis of pincodes so that searching becomes easier.
